        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          When multiple people are looking at a projection screen or crowded around a desktop monitor, the use of large shared displays lack support for co-presence collaboration and simultaneous interaction. 
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          We designed the <b>Mixed Reality Passthrough Window</b>, a laptop characterized by two screens, situated back to back, with two mounted cameras, facing in opposite directions. This creates the effect of looking through a window, upon which virtual content can be augmented and overlaid. The configuration allows local users sitting around the laptop to more easily interact with remote users, who appear on both sides, giving the sense that all users are sharing the same space in the round.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitle iterative">Ideation</div>
        <div class="body-text">
          The growth in remote and hybrid work has resulted in an increased demand for collaborative experiences that offer a more seamless and immersive transition between virtual and physical environments. 
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
         However, there has been little effort in exploring the presence of spatial cues for face-to-face and remote collaboration beyond the conventional one screen and one front facing camera setup.
        </div>
         <div class="body-text">
         Previous works have discovered new ways of augmenting forward facing and rear facing cameras and screens such as the <a href="https://vimeo.com/745406319" target="_blank"> Janus Table </a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H9Ul0sApqy9" target="_blank">Mixed Reality Large Screen Mobile Telepresence Robots</a>, but these solutions require fixed displays, multiple connected devices, or external projection units that limit the extent of mixed reality collaboration due to their individualistic nature and lack of portability. 
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          To address this, we brainstormed a new paradigm for the integration of augmented reality into a laptop design.

          Design Process
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          We chose a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400-unit/" target="_blank">Rapsberry Pi 400</a> as our operating system as it fits every conceivable definition we could make for a computer all in one compact keyboard: it has a CPU, a GPU, RAM, I/O (GPIO, HDMI, USB, Ethernet, etc.) and storage. 
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          To pair with the Raspberry Pi, we used 
          two <a href="https://www.sunfounder.com/collections/touchscreens/products/10inch-touchscreen-for-raspberrypi" target="_blank">SunFounder touchscreens</a> to serve as the front and back laptop displays and two <a href="https://www.arducam.com/product/raspberry-pi-camera-5mp-autofocus-motorized-focus-camera-b0176/" target="_blank">Arducams</a> to serve as the front and back facing cameras.

          <b>Cardboard Prototype</b>
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          We began to build our first protype by assembling the keyboard, displays, and cameras together with cardboard. 
        </div>
        <img
        class="body-image"
        src="images/cardboard.png"

      <div class="figure-caption"> First cardboard prototype of laptop. </div>
      <br></br>
      <div class="body-text">
        Through this process, we realized that we had to rethink the casing in order to accmodate for thickness of the displays, wire management, and hinge placement. We took these factors into consideration during our next step, whcih was to 3D model and print a better casing for the laptop. During this stage, we did bounce back to cardboard prototyping a few times, espcially to check dimensions of our 3D models before we print. 
      </div>
      <div class="body-text">
        <b>Top Casing</b>
      </div>
      <div class="body-text">
        We originally looked into other laptop cases for inspiration such as the pi-top. However, we found it difficult to find existing casing that would enclose both of the screens and support their weight at the same time. We turned to making our own variations and experimented with ways to prop the displays (making inserts, creating vessels, etc.)
       </div>
       <div class="body-text">
       Ultimately, we designed the top casing so that the displays are sitting into a middle structure, in which there are lids on both ends to make them stay in place. We also added screw hole posts in the corners to keep the two lids and the middle section together. 
      </div>

    <div class="body-text">
        <b>Bottom Casing</b>
      </div>
      <div class="body-text">
        At the begining, we designed the bottom casing to only reflect the extrusions of where the mouse and keybaord would sit in. We quicly realized that this was not ideal as the polylactic acid (material from the 3D printing), took up space and added dead weight. 
        We then looked into ways on how to hollow out the bottom case without leaving the internals exposed. Our solution was a box-and-lid like method.

        <b>Hinges</b>
      </div>
       
      <div class="body-text">
        We struggled the most figuring out how to integrate hinges into the laptop design. When deciding on what hinge to choose from, we ruled out door hinges and 3D printing them as these types would be too flimsy and would not support our two screens at a 90 degree angle. We decided to use laptop specific hinges. However, the ones that were the most compatible had quite awkard shapes to work with and was difficult to get the exact dimmesions. So, we first went back to sketching how the hinge might work with our laptop. 
        </div>
      
      <img

    <div class="figure-caption">Sketch of hinge joining top and bottom casing.</div>
    <br>
    <br />
      <div class="body-text">
       From there, we tested multiple hinge designs to connect the two casings. Additionally, we tested hole sizes and hexagonal sizes (for screws and screwposts) and how much they should be indented into the middle piece for the top casing. 
        After individually testing both the right and left hinge sizes to get the correct dimensions, we incorporated our hinge designs into the top casing and bottom casing.

        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
          Designing laptop cases are difficult. 
          We hope to make many more iterations of the casing and integrate with the software to make the final product.
